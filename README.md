Group Members: Nick Lang, Josiah Moye, Steven Adams

JobNinja matches users to companies based off of complementary personalities. Users take a personality test, and then enter url's to pages that are reflective of the tenor of a company. This url could be a company's about page or link to a job description. A list of words is generated for both the user's personality, and the company's description. WordNet is then used, through a python script on the server, to parse a similarity rating between the user and company.
